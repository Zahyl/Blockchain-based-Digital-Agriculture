        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <h3>We aim to empower small-scale farmers with information, leading the way in global digital agriculture transformation. Food security is a topic that everyone needs to be aware of. Carib.Farm is an organisation that works toward raising awareness. We give farmers the opportunity to make informed decisions about farming practices, agribusiness, crop and livestock production.</h3>
        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <h3>Lack of adequate climate-smart farming information is a widespread problem. With an unsustainable ratio of farmers to agricultural extension support, Caribbean farmers experience this lack of information more acutely than most.
            As the manager of her small family farm in the Caribbean, Founder Laura Macneil experienced this issue first-hand. It was through these challenges that her passion to find a digital solution was born.
            As a start-up, CaribFarm has received local and international attention. In 2021 CaribFarm participated in the UN Food Systems Summit and 2022 as finalist in the Female Founders Competition.Carib.Farm will launch in the Caribbean, collaborating with agriculture experts and industry stakeholders, with the goal to scale across the ACP regions.</h3>
