# Blockchain Architecture for Digital Agriculture

This repository showcases the development of a blockchain-based application for the agriculture industry in collaboration with Carib Farm, a company dedicated to empowering small-scale Caribbean farmers through accessible information and financial support. Our goal was to create a secure and transparent platform for microfinanciers to provide financial assistance to farmers.

We built the blockchain-based application using Node.js and Kaleido Cloud Blockchain, an Ethereum-based Blockchain as a Service (BaaS). Ethereum's blockchain offers benefits such as security, compliance, scalability, constant uptime, and high availability. Additionally, Ethereum's smart contracts facilitated a self-executing contract system with terms of agreement written directly into the code.

For authentication and database management, we used Firebase Firestore, while Amazon Amplify hosted the website. The project took four months to complete, with continuous testing throughout each stage. The resulting prototype demonstrates blockchain technology's potential to streamline funding processes, promote financial inclusion for farmers, and support a resilient and sustainable agricultural sector in the Caribbean.

By leveraging Ethereum-based blockchain and smart contracts using Solidity, we developed a decentralized, tamper-proof, and transparent platform that ensures trustworthiness and accountability in financial transactions. This blockchain-based solution aligns with our vision of empowering small-scale farmers and leading the global digital agriculture transformation.
