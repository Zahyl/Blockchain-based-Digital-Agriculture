### Overview

This repository showcases the development of a blockchain-based application for the agriculture industry in collaboration with Carib Farm, a company dedicated to empowering small-scale Caribbean farmers through accessible information and financial support. Our goal was to create a secure and transparent platform for microfinanciers to provide financial assistance to farmers.

### Technology Stack

- **Node.js:** The application is built using Node.js, a popular runtime environment for server-side applications.

- **Kaleido Cloud Blockchain:** We utilized Kaleido Cloud Blockchain, an Ethereum-based Blockchain as a Service (BaaS), to implement the blockchain infrastructure. Ethereum's blockchain provides several benefits, including security, compliance, scalability, constant uptime, and high availability.

- **Ethereum Smart Contracts:** The project leverages Ethereum's smart contracts, which enable a self-executing contract system with terms of agreement written directly into the code.

- **Firebase Firestore:** For authentication and database management, we integrated Firebase Firestore.

- **Amazon Amplify:** The website is hosted on Amazon Amplify.

### Project Timeline

The project took four months to complete, with continuous testing throughout each stage. The resulting prototype demonstrates blockchain technology's potential to streamline funding processes, promote financial inclusion for farmers, and support a resilient and sustainable agricultural sector in the Caribbean.

### Key Features

By leveraging Ethereum-based blockchain and smart contracts using Solidity, we developed a decentralized, tamper-proof, and transparent platform that ensures trustworthiness and accountability in financial transactions. This blockchain-based solution aligns with our vision of empowering small-scale farmers and leading the global digital agriculture transformation.
