### Overview

This repository showcases the development of a blockchain-based application for the agriculture industry in collaboration with Carib Farm, a company dedicated to empowering small-scale Caribbean farmers through accessible information and financial support. Our goal was to create a secure and transparent platform for microfinanciers to provide financial assistance to farmers.

### Technology Stack

- **Node.js:** The application is built using Node.js, a popular runtime environment for server-side applications.

- **Kaleido Cloud Blockchain:** We utilized Kaleido Cloud Blockchain, an Ethereum-based Blockchain as a Service (BaaS), to implement the blockchain infrastructure. Ethereum's blockchain provides several benefits, including security, compliance, scalability, constant uptime, and high availability.

- **Ethereum Smart Contracts:** The project leverages Ethereum's smart contracts, which enable a self-executing contract system with terms of agreement written directly into the code.

- **Firebase Firestore:** For authentication and database management, we integrated Firebase Firestore.

- **Amazon Amplify:** The website is hosted on Amazon Amplify.

### Key Features

1. **Decentralized and Tamper-Proof Platform:** By leveraging Ethereum-based blockchain and smart contracts using Solidity, we developed a decentralized, tamper-proof, and transparent platform. This ensures trustworthiness and accountability in financial transactions.

2. **Empowering Small-Scale Farmers:** The platform aims to empower small-scale farmers by providing them with easy access to financial assistance and information.

3. **Promoting Financial Inclusion:** Through the use of blockchain technology, the platform promotes financial inclusion for farmers who may have limited access to traditional financial services.

4. **Resilient and Sustainable Agriculture:** The project supports a resilient and sustainable agricultural sector in the Caribbean by streamlining funding processes and facilitating secure transactions.

### Project Timeline

The project took four months to complete, with continuous testing throughout each stage. The resulting prototype demonstrates blockchain technology's potential to revolutionize the agricultural industry and contribute to the global digital agriculture transformation.
